# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: 18-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a bash script that renames files in my downloads directory, also learnt Markdown basics.

**Thoughts** Still have a lot to learn in Bash scripting. Looking forward to making more scripts.




### Day 2: 19-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt how to handle user input in bash. Started learning how bash handles input and output, hope to finish that tommorrow

**Thoughts** I feel I just need to learn a few more things before i start making complex scripts



### Day 3: 20-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt how to handle input and output in bash. Started learning about signals that opens up new possibilities with bash scripts. I'll try to finish the chapter on that, then the learn how functions work and i think i should have the basics of bash scripting down.

**Thoughts** I feel I can be better at managing my time and learning concepts faster. 



### Day 4: 21-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do a lot today. Wasn't feeling to well but learnt about signals in bash. Learnt about cron tasks and how to use the anacron program

**Thoughts** Almost done with learning the basics of bash. I feel like I need 1 more day and I can start writing complex scripts.

### Day 5: 22-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: learnt about functions in bash. There are a lot of caveats to note when using them in scripts

**Thoughts** I hope i'm able to write a script tommorrow.

### Day 6: 23-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a little script in bash that opens up vlc media player from the terminal without showing errors. Super happy that i made that cause it has been bugging me for months

**Thoughts** Yea I'm pretty exicted that I know the basics to build some things. Hopefully i build the pomodoro timer I want to build in python tomorrow.




### Day 7: 24-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a bash script that automates the initialization of a git repo depending on if it's a bash or python project. 

**Thoughts** Automating scripts are cool. I can' wait to create more. I'll try to find things that I do repeatedly that might be better of automated.




### Day 8: 25-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: Learn about mounting filesystems in linux and made a bash script that automatically mounts my windows partition 

**Thoughts** Still have a lot to learnt but this journey has been exicting so far
