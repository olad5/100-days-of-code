# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: 18-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a bash script that renames files in my downloads directory, also learnt Markdown basics.

**Thoughts** Still have a lot to learn in Bash scripting. Looking forward to making more scripts.




### Day 2: 19-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt how to handle user input in bash. Started learning how bash handles input and output, hope to finish that tommorrow

**Thoughts** I feel I just need to learn a few more things before i start making complex scripts
