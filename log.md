# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: 18-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a bash script that renames files in my downloads directory, also learnt Markdown basics.

**Thoughts** Still have a lot to learn in Bash scripting. Looking forward to making more scripts.




### Day 2: 19-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt how to handle user input in bash. Started learning how bash handles input and output, hope to finish that tommorrow

**Thoughts** I feel I just need to learn a few more things before i start making complex scripts



### Day 3: 20-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: I learnt how to handle input and output in bash. Started learning about signals that opens up new possibilities with bash scripts. I'll try to finish the chapter on that, then the learn how functions work and i think i should have the basics of bash scripting down.

**Thoughts** I feel I can be better at managing my time and learning concepts faster. 



### Day 4: 21-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: Didn't do a lot today. Wasn't feeling to well but learnt about signals in bash. Learnt about cron tasks and how to use the anacron program

**Thoughts** Almost done with learning the basics of bash. I feel like I need 1 more day and I can start writing complex scripts.

### Day 4: 22-07-2021

**Today's Progress**: learnt about functions in bash. There are a lot of caveats to note when using them in scripts

**Thoughts** I hope i'm able to write a script tommorrow.
